<p>Such a defining album for UK indie rock, not only was it the peak of a whole movement but it was also a showcase of the power of the internet instead of traditional promotion via a big record label - the band were signed to an independent label and used the internet to gain a following through social media which was virtually unprecedented at the time. The subsequent singles and album were well worth the hype - from the opening song The View From The Afternoon you get amazing lyrics, incredible guitar riffs and a brilliant performance from frontman Alex Turner that plants catchy hook after catchy hook in your head for hours - this continues for the rest of the album too</p>

  <button id="myBtn7">Joy Division - Unknown Pleasures</button>

  <!-- The Modal -->

      <span4 class="close7">&times;</span4>
<p> This shows how well this album has held up - it’s more than that really, the album’s popularity and critical acclaim has grown rapidly since its release, as it’s now regarded as one of the best British albums of all time. I hadn’t heard the album until I began my research for this episode (I’ll warn you ahead of time that this’ll be the case for many episodes to come), but when I did I appreciated the distinct sound it had compared to the abrasive and in-your-face style of punk music. My discovery of Unknown Pleasures isn’t too far away from when I introduced myself to the defining punk songs like Anarchy In The UK, Oh Bondage Up Yours and so on, so it felt easy to compare the two; whereas punk is all about being in close proximity to the listener by getting right up in your face to tell you about their anger and strife, the post-punk on Unknown Pleasures is built on playing with space and elements feeling isolated from each other. A big part of this is down to the work of the album’s producer Martin Hannett who would use relatively new at the time techniques like recording each part of the drum separately to create a more industrial sound. Of course this was a two-way street, as the superb compositions of the band combined with lead singer Ian Curtis’ enigmatic performances where he uses his limited lower baritone range to its fullest extent by fully expressing every emotion he’s feeling - they were just as important as the production. Bassist Peter Hook described it best “We gave him great songs, and like a top chef, he added some salt and pepper and some herbs and served up the dish. But he needed our ingredients.”

  <p>The album is regarded as one of the best rock albums of the 90s, as well as just albums of the 90s, and also by some as just one of the best albums of all time. Not only was the critical reception overwhelmingly positive both at first and over time, but it saw big commercial success too with 3 top ten singles, the first of which charted at number 3 on the UK top 40.</p>

<p>Ocean was viewed as a potential breakout star of wildly popular collective Odd Future in the early 2010s and cranked up the hype further with his 2011 mixtape Nostalgia Ultra. All he had to do was stick the landing with his debut album but he went above and beyond with a brilliant and eclectic mix of songs. </p>
